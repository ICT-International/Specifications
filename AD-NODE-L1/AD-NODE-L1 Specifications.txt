AD-NODE-L1 Specifications
-------------------------

ADLA3:
	Sensor Inputs:
		* 2 x Analog Voltage sensor inputs SE, 0-3.0volts, Input Impedance: 400 to 600kiloohms typically (Both Inputs validated May 2025).
		* 1 x NTC Thermistor, typically suitable for 10kohm @ 25degrees C thermistor, Beta value/constants change at the same time for both thermistors.
		* 1 x 4-20mA input, with 12volt @ 30mA MAX supply power.
		* 4-20mA sensor power settling time 1 to 10 seconds, in 1second steps, note sensor power generated only during measurement period)
		* 4x Pulse Counter
				* Normally Open / Internally pulled up to 3.0volts
	Additional Features:
		* Accelerometer to derive the orientation of the node box.
		* Powered via user replaceable 3 x AA batteries, suggested L91 Lithium
		* Constant 3.000volt power source (two wire ports) allowing up to 15mA max (Note: not protected against overpower.)
	LoRa/LoRaWAN: 
		* LoRa MAC Version: 1.0.2 (With RP001 Regional Parameters 1.0.2 revision B)
		* Supports Class A (Class B and C Not Supported)
		* OTAA Supported: Yes
		* ABP Supported: Not Validated.
		* ADR Supported: Yes
		* Confirmed Messaging Supported: Yes, subject to local laws, set to disabled by default.
		* Sub Bands Supported for AU915 and US915: FSB1 to FSB8.


ADLA2:
