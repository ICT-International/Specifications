AD-NODE-L1 Specifications
-------------------------

ADLA3:
	Sensor Inputs:
		2 x Analog Voltage sensor inputs SE, 0-3.0volts, Input Impedance: 400 to 600kiloohms typically (Both Inputs validated May 2025).
		1 x NTC Thermistor, typically suitable for 10kohm @ 25degrees C thermistor, Beta value/constants change at the same time for both thermistors.
		1 x 4-20mA input, with 12volt @ 30mA MAX supply power.
		4-20mA sensor power settling time 1 to 10 seconds, in 1second steps, note sensor power generated only during measurement period)
	Additional Features:
		Accelerometer to derive the orientation of the node box.
		Powered via user replaceable 3 x AA batteries, suggested L91 Lithium
	LoRa/LoRaWAN: 
		LoRa MAC Version: 1.0.2 (With RP001 Regional Parameters 1.0.2 revision B)
		Supports Class A (Class B and C Not Supported)
		OTAA Supported: Yes
