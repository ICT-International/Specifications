				* 12Volt DC Sensor Power persistent or on demand
			* 4 x Analog Single Ended 0 - 3.0volt input range
				* Selectable 2.5volt, 5volt and 12volt Excitation Power (persistent or on demand follows SDI spec)
			* 4x Pulse Counter
				* Normally Open / Internally pulled up to 3.0volts
				* 3.0volt persistent power available.
			* 1 x CS506 FireStick

		Cellular Supported Features/Settings:
			* LTE-M CAT-M1 and NB-IoT NB2
			* BG95-M6 Modem
			* APN
			* Operator Code / MCC+MNC

			* MQTT Topic-Publish
		Microsoft Azure IoTHub Support:
			* SharedAccessKey: Supported
			* Requires the use of symmetric key authentication thus has a device connection string with the following pattern:
				HostName=<IOT_HUB_NAME>;DeviceId=<DEVICE_NAME>;SharedAccessKey=<PRIMARY_OR_SECONDARY_KEY>
				E.G.	mqtt azureconn HostName=mycloudserver.com;DeviceId=MNCM4xxxx;SharedAccessKey=8Z1Yid4K25AU0pXlGadH0iIR9U9or5DUmwwQ4I0MFo=
